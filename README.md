I've done with Git Immersion and I am now very familiar with the terminal commnds
Another aspect that I learned while doing Git Immersiion is becoming comfortable with searching stuff on the net when you hit roadblocks
Sites such as stack exchange were pretty helpful for the above point
Apart from that I've started off with the Deep Learning coursera courses and am looking to gain momentum
