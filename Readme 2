I am currently doing the Deep Learning courses, wherein we started from a basic neutral network having a single layer to multiple layers
It turns out Deep Learning is just a fancy word for a neural network with multiple layers. I have become really comfrtable with forward and backward propagation
The past month had't been very productive owing to a week long trip and other commitments. But I look forward to gaining momentum
